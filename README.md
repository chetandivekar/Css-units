# CSS Units:
## Relative and absolute

### There are only "5" units that are commonly used.

```bash
    px, vh-vw, %, em, rem
```

###  Relative:
Changes with either relative to body or parent.
```bash
Eg: % - Changes with the parent
    vw , vh - Changes with the body and not with the parent 
```

###  Absolute:
Does not Changes and remains same.
```bash
Eg: px
```

## Now there are "em" and "rem" units
#### This units are relative to the font sizes.
"r" stand for the root

```bash
Eg: em - It is relative to the parent's font size.
    rem - It is relative to the root font size which is by default is 16 px
```

Therefore  we can say, **1 rem = 16 px**
